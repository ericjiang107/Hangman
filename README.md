Progress 1: Completed the inital setup for hangman where player can guess letter until it matches with randomized word from computer. 

Progress 2: Added counter before failure. However, the counter needs to exit the program once it reaches 0. Needs further implementing... Also need to add player input
to quit during the letter guessing -- need to update changes where it fills all possible letters. 

Progress 3: Fixed counter before failure/display Game Over once max failed attempts and cleaned up previous code.
